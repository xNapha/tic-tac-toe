## Change logs

### 28/08/2023 | Project Creation
 Start of the project was a little bit bump, even though i read the documentation and followed along with the [lessons](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). I still had trouble figuring out the syntax, luckily the compiler was very helpful in telling me what I have to change inorder to make it compile. This just further solidifies the fact that I need to practise anything to fully understand the concepts, because just reading the theory and doing some code alongs dont cement the ideas properly.

 Other than syntax I have having a quite enjoyable time creating a rust program.
